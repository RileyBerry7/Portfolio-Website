            <h2 href="#" id="about-me"> About me<br></h2>
            <p> I'm Riley Berry, a 21-year-old Computer Science undergrad at Cal State Fullerton, with a relentless passion for technology. Striving to bridge academia and industry, I'm diligently pursuing my degree while balancing a part-time job, honing my time management and problem-solving skills. My journey into the world of computer science began with an innate curiosity, and I'm eager to translate my academic knowledge into real-world impact. I envision myself as a future contributor to the dynamic tech industry, with a steadfast commitment to continuous learning and innovation, poised to tackle the exciting challenges that lie ahead. <br><br><br><br><br></p>
            <h2 href="#" id="work-experience">Work experience<br></h2>
            <p> Although I have yet to break into the inustry for the career which I am pursuing, my past roles in the fast-food industry, including my time at In-N-Out, have instilled in me a strong work ethic, exceptional teamwork abilities, and effective time management skills. I'm eager to leverage these qualities as I embark on my journey to break into the computer science industry.<br><br><br><br><br></p>
            <h2 href="#" id="skills"> Skills<br></h2>
            <p> I possess a diverse skill set that encompasses both technical and soft skills. On the technical side, I am fluent in C++ and Python, with a solid understanding of Java and previous experience in Android app development using Kotlin and HTML. I also have extensive proficiency in AutoCAD programs such as SketchUp and Revit, along with a good grasp of 3D modeling using Blender and rudimentary experience with Unreal Engine 4 and 5. 
                <br><br> am well-versed in GUI development using platforms like Qt and Android Studio and have a foundational understanding of SQL and SQLite, which I have applied in various projects. My expertise extends to object-oriented programming and a deep understanding of common data structures. My years of modding have honed my technical problem-solving skills.
                <br><br>Beyond technical skills, I excel in team environments, thanks to my experience in agile development and team structures. I thrive on collaborative projects and contribute effectively to achieve shared goals. Overall, my skills are a testament to my adaptability and ability to deliver results both individually and within a team context. <br><br><br><br><br></p>
            <h2 href="#" id="projects"> Projects<br></h2>
            <p> <h3><u>Recipe Maker/Finder Database App (Android Studio and Kotlin):</u><br></h3>
                In collaboration with a team, I developed a Recipe Maker/Finder Android application using Android Studio and Kotlin. The app integrated the MealDB API as a backend, enabling users to search for a wide variety of recipes and apply filters to refine their search. One of my primary responsibilities was crafting the app's graphical user interface (GUI) and enhancing the overall front-end user experience. Additionally, I implemented features that allowed users to save their favorite recipes, ensuring that the data persisted even after closing the app. This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in Android app development but also showcased my skills in designing intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces.
                <br><br>
                <h3><u>College Map Itinerary Application (C++, Qt, SQL):</u><br></h3>
                In a collaborative effort with fellow students, I contributed significantly to the development of a College Map Itinerary application using C++, Qt, and SQL. This project aimed to create a simulated map featuring numerous colleges across the United States. Users could compile a personalized list of colleges they intended to visit and then employ a range of common traversal algorithms within the application to navigate their map. My role encompassed extensive work on the GUI to ensure a user-friendly experience. Additionally, I implemented a parser that facilitated the conversion of data from a .csv file into our SQL database, streamlining the data management process. This project underscored my proficiency in C++, Qt, and SQL, as well as my ability to collaborate within a team to deliver a functional and efficient software solution. <br><br><br><br><br></p>
